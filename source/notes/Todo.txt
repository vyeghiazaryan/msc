===============

* Upgrade Watershed to support 4/6-connected as well as 8/26-connected.
* Import the fixes to Waterfall and make sure they're correct.
* Import the IPF code.
  - But tidy it up - it's a bit of a mess at the moment.
* Implement MAST (the Millipede Automatic Segmentation Tool).
  - Base it on FAST.
  - Allow 3D volumes to be viewed from each of the three main directions.
* Add proper doc comments.
